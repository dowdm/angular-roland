# **Roland(US)- Partial Analog**

#### By Matt Dowdney

### This is a partial clone of the Roland US website from https://www.roland.com/us/ as viewed from a medium sized viewport(desktop/laptop).  The main objectives will be 1) resembling the main page from a component perspective(roughly); 2)connecting to  a product database to retrieve products' information (note: news and videos will not be in a database); 3)routing to different product pages dynamically. The only "fully" developed models and database are for the products.

## User Stories

| View  | Feature | Component |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| Home | Homepage should display featured products | Root |
| Home | Homepage should display featured videos | Root |
| Home | Homepage should display featured news| Root |
| Home | Selected featured product should reveal product details | Root |
| Home | Selected featured news should reveal featured news details | Root|
| All | Nav-bar should route user to appropriate paths | Nav-bar |
| Home | Selected featured product should route to page of that product | Product-Details |
| Product | Selected  product should route to page of that product | Product-Details |
| Authentication | User can dummy register a product (hollow function) | Login |

To-do: Create a registration model and push actually registered devices to a database.
