# **Roland(US)- Partial Analog**

#### By Matt Dowdney

### This is a partial clone of the Roland US website from https://www.roland.com/us/ as viewed from a medium sized viewport(desktop/laptop).  The main objectives will be 1) resembling the main page from a component perspective(roughly); 2)connecting to  a product database to retrieve products' information (note: news and videos will not be in a database); 3)routing to different product pages dynamically.

## Current User Stories

| Home | Homepage should display featured videos | Root |
| Home | Homepage should display featured news| Root |
| Home | Selected featured product should reveal product details | Root |
| Home | Selected featured news should reveal featured news details | Root|

## Future User Stories

TO-DO: Implement Firebase database for Products, Implement Routing to Selected Product Details Paths, Clean and polish UI

    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
