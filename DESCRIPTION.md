a brief interpretation of the roland website(from top to bottom):

There is a top navbar with 10 divisions. The elements  are, from left to right: roland logo, 7 navigation button elements, user login/signup button, searchbox.[Element navbutton]


Next there is a carousel that displays 7 elements on a timer, one at a time. Six of them are new products. One is a blurb about Roland's creative values. Useful to break up monotony of hawking products and makes company seem "aware". This is the focus of the website.  [Element main-carousel]

Beneath the carousel are three sections, identically formatted that contain three elements. The top-most is a featured product, the middle is a featured video, the bottom is "what's new", essentially news. Each of these sections displays 3 elements at once and has carousel capabilities.[Elements featured-product, featured-video, whats-new]

Beneath the "What's New" section there is a 4x3 grid of images, that are also links, that represent the 12 categories of products Roland produces. [Element product-categories]

Next, there is a 5 part footer. It's essentially all links. The top section links to their international sites. The next section has their social media links and links to buy their products/support. Next there is the pretty standard columns of links falling into the "Products", "Community", "Support", "Company", et cetera categories. Fourth, there are two large images that link to their sister/child companies. Finally there are the links to privacy, copyright, terms of use, and other legally required or recommended literature. [I'm guessing these are 5 elements]
